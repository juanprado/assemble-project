					Nursing an infant can prove challenging when in public areas ! Apron style nursing covers are plentiful on the market.  We designed our scarf differently with not only function but with fashion in mind.  Our scarf is a fashion accessory that is used during the nursing period. The scarf is worn instead of carried in the diaper bag and also remains a staple item in your wardrobe for years to come.
